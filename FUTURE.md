# Future plans for GoAddons

## Make Docker dependency deprecated
1. Change from MySQL to a simple SQLite database that makes it easier to ship instead of requiring Docker.
2. Look into possibility of not requiring the Docker Chrome browser when downloading files.

## Refactoring and generic clean-up

1. Part of the clean-up and refactoring involves more restrict code styling and that is something that is coming!
   *. Discuss the possibility of using formatters e.g. gofmt or perhaps Go linters?
2. Refactoring and making code easier to read and follow (the less jumping around the better)
3. Generic Clean-up and whatever that would entail!
