# Contributing to GoAddons

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
- Follow our coding standards and style guide
- Write tests for your changes
- Ensure the test suite passes
- Make sure your code lints
- Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [license](LICENSE)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [Issues](../../issues)

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* More coding style related changes and rules are to come soon. Keep yourself up-to-date!

## Code of Conduct

In short, don't be a jerk. Be respectful and considerate in your interactions.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [license](LICENSE).
